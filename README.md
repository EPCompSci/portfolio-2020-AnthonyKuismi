# Computer Science Portfolio by Anthony Kuismi


# About my Coding Career
The first time I ever learned about code was sometime around 3rd grade it was not much with only being exposed to scratch which you were able to use blocks and not actual lines of code. A few years later somewhere in middle school I messed around in python for a bit and made some simple games in python. After that I was gonna take APCSP but my class got cancled and wasted time intro to tech. Finally, I got to Ap Computer Science where I had fun learning how to code in java and understand basic principles like classes and methods. Then after that class ended I still wanted to have fun coding so I took this class which I was able to do what I like the most in coding which is making games. Over these multiple languanges, Python, Java, and Swift I found that the best way for me to learn was to try and make games with my own ideas and learn new concepts on the way. Aditionally I also took cyber security this year where I learned about computer security and how to use terminal,html, and a refresher on python.


2019-2020 Portfolio
# Java-Portfolio
This is one of the projects I made by my self and I learned about genetic algorithms and how to use them to make cool things like Rockets that learn how to avoid obstacles. 
[Smart Rockets](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Smart-Rockets/blob/main/README.md)

This was and end of the year project that I worked on with a partner in Java to show are leanring. We made a gambling game similar to a roullette.

2020-2021 Portfolio

# iOS-Portfolio

This is the first app I have made using swift I followed a tutorial series on youtube(link in readme) on how to make pong and then I added some particles 
[Pong](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Pong)

This is one of the first projects I made without tutorials. I learned how to make sound and I learned how to make a basic menu.
[Rocketeer](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Rocketeer)

This is a my first group project in are Ios class. I have learned about animation and how to make menus for games using sprite kit.
[Super Bird Fighter Ultra](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra)

The final project I worked with a different person instead of a group we learned about tilemaps and top down style dungeon crawler mechanics in spritekit
[Dungeon Dino aka CodeHazel](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/CodeHazel)


*More information is available for the projects are in the readmes of the repositories.
