This is one of the first app

This is a my first group project in are Ios class. Super Bird Fighter Ultra is a going to be a fighting game that you can use different birds to fight each other with like in mortal combat. Each bird will have different things they can do and different attributes like health and speed. So far as of Nov. 3 we have created a basic start menu, some basic movement physics with particle walk dust, and some animations for player movement. We hope that this game will be a fun and unique fighting game.
